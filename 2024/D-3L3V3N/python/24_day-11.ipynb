PROBLEM: The ancient civilization on Pluto was known for its ability to manipulate spacetime, and while The Historians explore their infinite corridors, you've noticed a strange set of physics-defying stones. At first glance, they seem like normal stones: they're arranged in a perfectly *straight line*, and EACH stone has a *number* engraved on it. The strange part is that every time you BLINK, the stones CHANGE:\n",

The LEFT half of the CURRENT stone's digits are engraved on the new left stone, and the RIGHT half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone. (NOTE: The new numbers don't keep extra leading zeroes: E.g. '1000' would become stones '10'(L) and '0'(R).)\n",
