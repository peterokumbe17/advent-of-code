    "# ! PROBLEM: As you're all teleported deep into the jungle, a monkey steals The Historians' device! You'll need to get it back while The Historians are looking for the Chief. You aren't sure how the Monkey Exchange Market works, but one of The Historians senses trouble and comes over to help. Apparently, they've been studying these monkeys for a while and have deciphered their *secrets*. Today, the Market is full of monkeys buying *good hiding spots*. Fortunately, because of the time you recently spent in this jungle, you know lots of good hiding spots you can sell! If you sell enough hiding spots, you should be able to get enough bananas to buy the device back.\n",

    "#   - secret_number = PRUNE(MIX(ROUND_DOWN((secret_number / 32), nearest_int)))\n",
