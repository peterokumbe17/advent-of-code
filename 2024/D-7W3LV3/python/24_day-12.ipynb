I would like you to please understand the following challenge and then generate a python function in order to solve it:\\n\\nI would like you to generate a python function that accepts a string grid populated with different uppercase letters. Each distinct upper case letter in the grid is known as a garden plot = a single grid block letter with 4 sides. Now, the entire grid consists of different regions of garden plots. 1 region is represented by the same garden plots (letters) touching each other each horiziontally and/or vertically. If however, a garden plot is found on its own in the grid (E.g. No other same garden plot letters are touching it horizontally or vertically), then this lone garden plot creates a region of its own. An area of a region = the total number of garden plots (letters) in the region. A perimeter of a region = the number of sides of same garden plots in a region that do NOT touch each other (E.g. a region \\'AAAA\\' is a region of \\'A\\' garden plots that exists in a straight line from left to right with area = 4 because there are 4 \\'A\\'s and perimeter = 10 because the number of outter garden plot sides that do not touch each other within the region = 10). A price of a region is calculated as: region area * region perimeter. Let\\'s see an example grid below:\\n\\nAAAA\\nBBCD\\nBBCC\\nEEEC\\n\\nIn the example above, The area of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region contains. The above map\\'s type A, B, and C plants are each in a region of area 4. The type E plants are in a region of area 3; the type D plants are in a region of area 1. Each garden plot is a square and so has four sides. The perimeter of a region is the number of sides of garden plots in the region that do not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type A and C plants are each in a region with perimeter 10. The type B and E plants are each in a region with perimeter 8. The lone D plot forms its own region with perimeter 4. Therefore, region A has a price 4 * 10 = 40, region B has price 4 * 8 = 32, region C has price 4 * 10 = 40, region D has price 1 * 4 = 4, and region E has price 3 * 8 = 24. So, the total price for this first example is 140. \\n\\nHowever, do keep in mind that garden plots of the same letter can also appear in multiple separate regions and regions can appear within other regions. Second example below:\\n\\nOOOOO\\nOXOXO\\nOOOOO\\nOXOXO\\nOOOOO\\n\\nThe example grid above contains 5 regions (1 containing all of the \\'O\\' garden plots and the other 4 each containing a single \\'X\\' garden plot). The four X regions each have area = 1 and perimeter = 4. The region containing 21 \\'O\\' garden plots is more complicated - in addition to its outer edge contributing a perimeter of 20, its boundary with each \\'X\\' region contributes an additional 4 to its perimeter, for a total perimeter of 36. In this second example above, the region with all of the \\'O\\' garden plots has price 21 * 36 = 756, and each of the four smaller X regions has price 1 * 4 = 4, for a total price of 772 (756 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4).\\n\\nThe generated python function should please print out a message for each region found in the grid in the following format: \"Region x with price: region_x_area * region_x_perimeter\", where \\'x\\' is the current region being traversed through.\\n\\n\\n'"

    "NOTE to future self (and other devs): Yes, I know you are expecting some 'def ...' python helper function here, but this was actually the ULTIMATE helper! :o So, long story short, I didn't have hours of time to sit and spend hours writing the code to solve this quite fun problem (I actually enjoy these maze problems, they just sometimes take time to convert the solutions to code, well for me at least). Therefore, I sat and understood the challenge and then wrote a well-constructed prompt about the challenge to input into AI and requested it to generate a python function solution to solve the problem for me and it worked! (I literally did not change any logic from the function that it generated for me - I neatened the code up and changed a few variables and return values to my liking and style but I left the main logic untouched :D).
